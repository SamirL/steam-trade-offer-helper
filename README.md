## Synopsis

I have decided to open source most of my side projects. This one included.

What does it do ?

Well it handles most of a Steam Trade Scenario and makes it easy for you to operate and handle trades.
The code is pretty self explanatory but i will maybe write some code example and how to use it later.

## Installation

  npm install

## License

Use it for anything and however you want. Licence IDC (I don't care)
